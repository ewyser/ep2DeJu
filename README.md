# ***ϵp2DeJu*** #
## **Description** 
This is a small Julia project and an implementation of the mechanical solver [ep2-3De v1.0](https://github.com/ewyser/ep2-3De) (written in C and CUDA C) in the Julia language. It solves explicit elasto-plastic problems within a finite deformation framework, i.e., logarithmic strains and kirchoff stresses, using the material point method with cubic B-Spline shape functions (instead of GIMP formulation in the original ``ep2-3De v1.0``).

* **Fig |** Slumping dynamics showing the accumulated plastic strain $\epsilon_p^{\mathrm{acc}}$ after an elastic load of 8 s and an additional elasto-plastic load of $\approx$ 7 s. 

The solver relies on random gaussian fields to generate initial fields $\psi(\boldsymbol{x})$, such as the cohesion $c(\boldsymbol{x})$ or the internal friction angle $\phi(\boldsymbol{x})$, which are taken as spatial variables instead of constant parameters.

* **Fig |** Initial cohesion field with average $\mu=20$ kPa with a variance $\sigma=5$ kPa. This corresponds to the initial condition for the result showed above.

## **Usage**

### Structure of the project
The general structure is given below:
```terminal
.
├── Manifest.toml
├── Project.toml
├── README.md
├── scripts
├── src
└── start_macOS.sh
```
The ```./scripts``` folder contains the following routines:
-  ```Nsim.jl``` 
-  ```sim.jl``` 
-  ```splineCheck.jl```
-  ```viz.jl```  

The ```./src``` folder contains all functions needed and are called by the different routines in ```./scripts```. The ```./out``` folder contains all the plots and data generated by the solver during computation. If needed, modifications can be made to these routines by changing initial parameters and so on. 

### ``101`` - How to ```ϵp2De()```  

0. (opt.) Get Julia [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and follow instructions
1. Navigate to the local repo ``` ./ep2DeJu ``` 
2. Launch Julia (on macOS, drag & drop ```start_macOS.sh``` in the terminal without navigating in terminal)
```julia
% julia --project  
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  Documentation: https://docs.julialang.org
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type "?" for help, "]?" for Pkg help.
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 1.6.5 (2021-12-19)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Official https://julialang.org/ release
|__/                   |
```
3. Enter pkg mode ``` ] ``` and instantiate the environment
```julia
(ep2DeJu) pkg> activate .
(ep2DeJu) pkg> instantiate 
(ep2DeJu) pkg> st
```
4. Compile using ``include("...")`` and run method ``ϵp2De(nel,isΔFbar)``
```julia
julia> include("./scripts/sim.jl")
julia> ϵp2De(80,false)
```
5. Input parameters: ``nel`` is the number of elements along the $x$ dim. and ``isΔFbar`` is a boolean argument (``true``/``false``) controlling volumetric locking corrections using $\Delta\bar{F}$ for the stress update (see [1,2]). 

5. The outputs (figs, gif, etc.) are saved in the folder ``` ./out/ ```
